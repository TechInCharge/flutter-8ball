# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## AppBrewery Course app

This is a sample app, learned as an exmaple from appbrewery.co course.
Even though it is from the course, but the code has been completly written from scratch.


## What did we create

The App is design to answer randomly your questions, so basically you ask a question, then click on the ball, and the ball will give you a random answer.
Below is the finished APP from my emulator.
